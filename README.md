# CSL_Choice

CSL_Choice_Paper.Rmd is an R markdown document that, when knitted, processes the EEG and behavioural data from an attention task, creates plots, runs statistical tests, and outputs everything as a word document written in the form of a scientific paper (published here: https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/32/11/2159/95517/Voluntary-Control-of-Task-Selection-Does-Not).

In this experiment, participants were given two tasks to perform. One was a simple categorisation task that was designed to develop an implicit attentional bias toward a type of visual feature. In the second task, participants performed an unrelated visual search task and we used behavioural and EEG measures to observe how the biases that they developed during the categorisation task, continued to bias their attention in the unrelated search task. Additionally, we tried to give people the maximum opportunity to prepare for the upcoming search task to see whether that would enable them to prepare for, and counteract, the effects of their previous categorisation task. Our behavioural and EEG measures showed that no amount of preparation and control was able to prevent a person's attention from being captured by the visual features that they had been biased toward by the categorisation task.
